# UTILITY-BILL-PAYMENT-SYSTEM

A Monthly Electricity Bill payment system developed and programmed using C++.

Tamil Nadu Electricity Board (TNEB) was formed on July 1, 1957 under section 54 of the Electricity (Supply) Act 1948 in the State of Tamil Nadu as a vertically integrated utility responsible for power generation, transmission and distribution. The electricity network has since been extended to all villages and towns throughout the State. As per the provisions under the section 131 of the Electricity Act,2003 TNEB was restructured on 1.11.2010 into TNEB Limited; Tamil Nadu Generation and Distribution Corporation Limited (TANGEDCO); and Tamil Nadu Transmission Corporation Limited (TANTRANSCO).

The total number of consumers being served in the State as on 31.03.17 is 279.27 Lakhs.

This project aims to develop a system to facilitate the consumers to pay the electricity current consumption charges bill online. Provision has also been made for the consumers to maintain e-wallet accounts with TANGEDCO in which, the consumers can maintain deposits from which they can pay the bills whenever bills are generated for their service connections.
